# Problem Formulation

## Input and Outputs

The input for the neural network will be two integers with some fixed upper limit.
The output will be their product. This is exclusively multiplication of two integers.

The representations is a research question.
The bit width is a research question.

## Training Data

For training data we will use some subset of all possible pairs, and the test data will be a non overlapping subset of all possible pairs. This is because we are interested in generalization.

## Architecture

The architecture is a research question, but we will start with simple feed forward networks and go from there. I ideally don't want to provide many inductive biases.

One goal is to keep the architecture differentiable end to end.

## Robustness

The real question is seeing if the learned circuit is robust. Not to length generalization but to adversarial perturbations.
