# Overview

This project is an experiment to see if we can have deep neural networks learn integer
multiplication, and then see how robust the learned circuit is.

This is not multiplication in the sense of floating point multiplication. It's integer multiplication.

In theory you can express for example, 4 bit integer mutliplication as a boolean circuit. So the question is if input output pairs of integer multiplication can be used to learn the general circuit in a deep neural network.

The code is in Python, using JAX/Flax for the neural networks.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by a lot of work involving the magical feature learning capabilities of deep neural networks.
